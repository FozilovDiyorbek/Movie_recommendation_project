# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using the **MovieLens dataset**.  
It implements **Content-Based Filtering**, **Collaborative Filtering**, and a **Hybrid Approach** to recommend movies.  
Additionally, the project provides both a **Streamlit web app** and a **FastAPI backend API** for deployment.

- **Collaborative Filtering** â†’ Recommends movies based on user ratings (using SVD from `surprise`).
- **Hybrid Model** â†’ Combines both approaches with a weighted score (`alpha` parameter).
- **Web App (Streamlit)** â†’ User-friendly UI to test recommendations.
- **REST API (FastAPI)** â†’ Provides endpoints for integration with other apps.
